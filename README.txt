Hello!

To whoever is opening this project:

In case the machine doesn't export the files properly and gives you an error
go to
Asset / Models / Sephirah 
From there, go to each named folder, and find the Colored 3D Model under each folder. 
For those Folders, open the model section at the top right of the inspector. 
Then check off "Migrate to vrm1", apply it, then check it again, and press the apply button again.

Essentially, the VRM export seems to be a little finicky and not read properly when transferring to new machines. Sorry about this!
